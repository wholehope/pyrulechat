1. **Pure Python Implementation**:
   - Utilize only the Python standard library and well-established Python packages.
   - Avoid creating new scripting languages; leverage Python's capabilities.

2. **Native Python Integration**:
   - Ensure straightforward integration with Python applications.
   - Eliminate the need for setting up a separate REST server for functionality.
