## Design Principles

1. **Pure Python Implementation**:
   - Utilize only the Python standard library and well-established Python packages.
   - Avoid creating new scripting languages; leverage Python's capabilities.

2. **Native Python Integration**:
   - Ensure straightforward integration with Python applications.
   - Eliminate the need for setting up a separate REST server for functionality.

## Installation

Since this library is intended for direct integration into your Python project, you have two primary methods to include it within your repository. You can either:

- Clone it as a nested repository within your existing repository. For more information on this approach, visit [Nested Repos within a Repo](https://www.wwwinsights.com/git-repo-inside-repo/).
- Utilize `git submodule` to maintain a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This is a useful tool for incorporating and tracking the changes of an external project within your own Git repository.
